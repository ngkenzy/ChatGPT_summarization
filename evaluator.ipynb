      "article is: (CNN) -- This Sunday, my family will be among the 110 million people gathered in front of their TVs to watch the Super Bowl, and with ad revenue projected at $300 million, we can expect advertisers to be as outrageous as ever, with spots promoting junk food, alcohol and erectile dysfunction drugs and depicting violence, sex and gender stereotypes. This said, TV ads -- even during the Super Bowl -- might be the least of parents' concerns. Digital media has dramatically changed the advertising landscape, and includes immersive websites, \"advergaming,\" viral marketing, mobile ads, social media marketing and precise behavioral and location targeting. More than ever before, advertising and entertainment are inextricably linked. In many cases, the content is the ad, and this can be particularly confusing for children, who are less able to understand persuasive intent. Common Sense Media just released a research brief -- \"Advertising to Children and Teens: Current Practices\" -- to provide an inventory of advertising practices aimed at kids and teens and calling for research to quantify exposure and examine the effects. The report finds that the integration of advertising and content across so many platforms -- from product placement to online games and Facebook apps -- has made it much more difficult for researchers to measure the exposure and impact of advertising on kids. While traditional advertising and its effects on kids have been well researched, no one knows the impact of these new media platforms. The concern isn't just what products are sold to kids or what messages are sent to them, it's that new modes of advertising are insidious and particularly troubling for kids and teens, who are less able to differentiate advertising from entertainment and whose sense of self is still developing. What does it mean for a tween or teen girl to receive weight-loss ads, targeted to her based on her age, gender, location, the foods she likes and the topics she searches? We need to understand the impact of this type of advertising on young people, what it means for their consumption habits, self-esteem, and right to privacy. Kids are also becoming a critical part of the product-selling cycle, without being paid (or even knowing, in many cases). Even Super Bowl advertisers are relying on our kids in large part to spread the word for them. For example, Doritos' \"Crash the Super Bowl\" ad contest has been seeking votes all over the Web -- including the kids' game site Addicting Games -- where information can be collected, and where likes, shares and views are the new measure of success. And a young person's \"liking\" or \"sharing\" of a product may appear in their friends' newsfeeds as endorsements or testimonials. No longer can you simply hit the mute button or fast-forward through the Viagra ads. Millions of kids will be on phones and tablets while watching the big game and the ads they interact with on these little screens -- that might not even register as ads -- have far greater implications for kids' healthy development. Media and ad savvy is now \n",

      "article is: Lord Tebbit said the Prime Minister will pay a heavy price for breaking a promise to tackle immigration . David Cameron can only hope to win the election if Ukip 'implodes', Tory grandee Lord Tebbit warned today. As the Conservatives launched their first election poster of the campaign, the former party chairman said the Prime Minister will pay a heavy price for breaking a promise to tackle immigration. He said that only a collapse in support for Ukip - which has made big gains in the past year - would allow the Tories to form an overall majority after May 7. Before the last election Mr Cameron pledge 'no ifs, no buts' to reduce net migration to the 'tens off thousands'. But latest figures show 260,000 more people arrived in the UK than left in the last year, including a record 228,000 extra immigrants who arrived from elsewhere in the European Union. Lord Tebbit told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: 'Mr Cameron swore that he would get immigration, net, down to tens of thousands, so that's a real problem,' he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. 'It makes it difficult for him to persuade people that he can control it without a radical change in our relationship with Europe, which Ukip would then point out would almost certainly mean leaving the European Union.' 'I think it is going to be very difficult to win an overall majority unless, for some reason or another, Ukip should implode.' The Prime Minister kicked off what expected to be four months of frenzied campaigning by the parties with an appeal to voters to 'stay on the road' to economic recovery. Addressing supporters in Halifax, West Yorkshire, he said the election would be 'the most important in a generation' and that any result other than a Conservative victory would be 'disastrous' for the country. David Cameron today launched the new Tory party campaign poster in Halifax, with the slogan 'Let's stay on the road to a stronger economy' Polling by YouGov shows how Ukip built its support during the last 12 months, including taking two seats in the Commons, winning the European elections and building a base on local councils . Speaking at the launch of the Conservatives first campaign poster of the year - with the slogan Let's Stay on the Road to a Stronger Economy - Mr Cameron said it was 'absolutely crucial' that the party triumphed in May. 'It is an absolutely vital election for our country and I think the most important election in a generation,' he said. 'I say we need to stay on the road to a stronger economy not just because the alternatives are so disastrous and, frankly, they are disastrous. 'I say that we should stay on this road because I'm absolutely clear about what the destination should be, about what more we can do for our country over the coming five years.' For Labour, shadow chancellor Ed Balls MP said the Conservatives' economic plan had failed and the country needed a change of course. \n",

      "article is: (CNN) -- It may not have been a great game until after the lights went out and came back up, but the Super Bowl showdown Sunday night created quite a few memorable moments on the field and off, even before kickoff. There were powerful performances, including a much buzzed-about halftime show by superstar Beyonce. But there was also a lack of electricity in the stadium and in some of the commercials. And San Francisco 49ers fans are sure to get emotional over that last play they ran on offense, when two players met in the end zone and, despite interference, the referee did not call a penalty. Here are the five moments you can expect your coworkers to talk about Monday morning. Grrrl Power . The men may have duked it out during the game, but when it came to the non-football entertainment at the Superdome, women ruled the day. First up was Jennifer Hudson with a stirring rendition of \"America the Beautiful.\" The choir backing her was composed of students from Sandy Hook Elementary, the Connecticut school where 20 students and six school staff were shot dead in December. Players on the sidelines and fans in the stands wiped away tears. \"Our wish is to demonstrate to America and the world that 'We are Sandy Hook and We Choose Love,'\" the choir said in a statement. Next, Alicia Keys belted out the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" as the children, in white polo shirts with green ribbons pinned to them, stood with their hands on their hearts. \"It's football. But I just cried,\" tweeted actor Brian Baumgartner about the Sandy Hook performance. The big show, however, came once the 49ers and the Baltimore Ravens got through the first half. Welcome, Beyonce. For 12 minutes, she rocked the stage clad in above-the-knee black stiletto boots and a leather minidress. Powered by an all-female backing band, there was little doubt Beyonce sang live -- unlike during President Barack Obama's inauguration last month where she admitted singing along with a prerecorded track. And as if that wasn't enough girl power for the night, Beyonce was joined by her Destiny's Child bandmates, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. \"Watching the #SuperBowl with family & friends. @Beyonce was phenomenal! I am so proud of her! -mo,\" tweeted none other than the first lady of the United States, Michelle Obama. She wasn't the only one. Beyonce's performance generated 5.5 million tweets! Lack of power . For the first two quarters, the Ravens seemed unstoppable, steamrolling the 49ers and building a 28-6 lead. But then, half the lights in the Superdome went black. Monitoring equipment sensed an abnormality in the building's electrical system and cut power to some sectors to isolate the issue. Power utility Entergy said the problem was a \"customer issue.\" The NFL released a statement saying it was \"investigating.\" The power company said it was not to blame and that electricity in the rest of the city was fine.

A fixated woman has been warned that she will be jailed if she continues to bombard a married vicar with cards, letters and gifts. Maureen Peace, 50, was given a 12 month community order and an indefinite restraining order last August, banning her from contacting the Rev Keith Rengert after she stalked him for two years. But Norwich Crown Court heard how she broke the restraining order within days by writing to Mr Rengert, 45, who is rector of Spixworth, Norfolk. Maureen Peace, 50, (left) was given an order of restraint after she became obsessed with the Reverend Keith Rengert (right), sending him messages and turning up at his house in Norfolk over a two-year period . She was due to be sentenced for the offence in October, but sentencing was adjourned for three months to see if she kept away from him. The court heard on Friday that her behaviour had been 'positive' since her earlier breach and she had made no further contact with the vicar. Judge Mark Lucraft gave her a new 12-month community and supervision order with a mental health requirement, with the restraining order left in place. But he warned her that she would go to jail if she breached the order again. The offence has a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. Ms Peace, who is from North Walsham, Norfolk, admitted a charge of harassment without violence between July 1 2010 and June 2 last year at an earlier hearing before Norwich magistrates. The court heard how Ms Peace became 'fixated' with the vicar and sent him messages saying that she loved him after he conducted her mother's funeral. But her persistent approaches were not appreciated by Mr Rengert when he was in his earlier post as curate at 14th century St Nicholas church in North Walsham. He asked her to stop contacting him and later complained to police who issued her with a warning, but her harassment continued. The court heard how she even turned up at the vicar's home that he shared with wife Helen and two children in North Walsham. She also declared her love for him in four Valentine's day cards on February 14 last year, describing him as 'the love of my life' and saying, 'I will be your sweetheart if you will be mine'. Ms Peace who is jobless and lives on income support and Disability Living Allowance was also banned from going to any church service in which Mr Rengert is taking part or officiating. The court was told how Nr Rengert first became concerned about Ms Peace's 'over familiarity' when she started writing to him and calling him by his first name. He told her to contact another priest instead of him after she asked him to 'cleanse' her home, but she ignored the request and carried on writing to him and leaving messages on his phone.

      "article is: (CNN) -- On a day when a report showed English Premier League clubs attract nearly EUR 150m ($193m) through shirt sponsorship deals, Newcastle United announced one of the biggest -- and most controversial -- in their history. The club has signed a four-year contract with 'digital finance company' Wonga, a pay-day firm one MP claims is nothing more than a \"legal loan shark.\" Named as the number one company in the Sunday Times Tech Track 100 list in 2011, Wonga lends money with an annual interest rate of 4,124%. The company, which is named after a slang term for money in Britain, declined to comment when contacted by CNN. \"We are completely transparent about the total cost of repayment and we make money when our customers repay us quickly, not by continually extending a growing line of credit,\" says Wonga's website. \"Like all companies we make the odd mistake, but we are serious about our commitment to responsible lending and try to put customers at the heart of what we do.\" As well as sponsoring Newcastle's shirts, Wonga has also bought the naming rights to the Magpies' stadium, reverting it back to its original St James' Park name. The club's owner Mike Ashley sparked a huge wave of protest from fans when he discarded 119 years of history by calling the ground the Sports Direct Arena, after his sports goods firm, back in 2011. Several key figures have criticized Ashley for striking the deal, saying it is irresponsible for such a big institution in a traditionally deprived area to carry the name of a firm that preys on vulnerable people. The partnership -- said to be worth $38m over four years -- underlines how increasingly important shirt deals are to top clubs, with a study by Sport+Markt showing they had pushed through the EUR 500m ($643m) barrier in Europe for the first time in 2012. Sport+Markt's report also reveals the most common shirt sponsor of Premier League clubs are firms from the betting and lottery sector, products of which are featured on the strips of six teams. British sports business expert Simon Chadwick told CNN one of the most important goals for sponsors is getting as many people as possible to see their brand name. The Premier League, with its estimated 4.7 billion viewers a year, is the perfect vehicle, he said. \"Such is the global prominence of the Premier League and the clubs within it, that shirt sponsors predictably and inevitably secure the 'eyeballs' they seek by engaging in sponsorship deals. \"In particular, there is a preponderance of gambling companies, largely because of the convergence of consumer interest in both football and gambling. \"In the case of Newcastle, there would appear to be an alignment of club and company expectations. \"For the club, the deal is an immediate source of revenue and also a smart way of returning United's stadium back to its St James' Park name; for the sponsor, given the socio-demographic and economic conditions of certain parts of the north-east, it is one way of targeting actual and potential \n",

      "article is: Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- After dumping intense rain and bringing strong winds to Haiti and Cuba on Saturday, Tropical Storm Isaac picked up steam -- and promised to pick up strength -- as it spun toward Florida. The storm left at least two people dead in the impoverished Caribbean nation of Haiti, pounding camps where hundreds of thousands of people live in tents. As the Haitian government and outside agencies continued to assess the damage, the focus surrounding Isaac increasingly turned toward Florida, much like the storm itself. Isaac was roughly 65 miles northeast of Camaguey, Cuba, and 340 miles east-southeast of Key West by late Saturday, moving at about 17 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm system is expected to gain strength and become a hurricane by early Monday as it moves past the Florida Keys and into the Gulf of Mexico. After barreling north -- affecting Florida's western coast along the way -- the storm is expected to pack 100 mph sustained winds by the time it makes landfall sometime late Tuesday afternoon or early evening on the Florida Panhandle, likely near Panama City, according to forecasters. That progression prompted Republican Party officials in Tampa to effectively push back Monday's scheduled start of the Republican National Convention one day, hoping the move will make it safer and easier for delegates to attend. Tropical storm conditions could first be felt there by late Sunday, and by late Monday afternoon and early evening, Isaac's eye should be west of the coastal city. Florida's governor, Rick Scott, insisted Saturday that his state will be ready for whatever happens. \"This is a state that has dealt with hurricanes forever,\" he told reporters Saturday in Broward County. \"We are a state that we know we have to get prepared for hurricanes.\" As preparations continue, authorities in Haiti spent Saturday assessing Isaac's aftermath. The country is still recovering from a devastating earthquake that struck more than two years ago, and its challenges are compounded by the fact it is led by a relatively new government with limited resources. All that said, the top U.N. humanitarian official in the nation praised the initial response efforts. \"So far, I think we're faring reasonably well in our response,\" Kevin Kennedy told CNN on Saturday afternoon, referring to the efforts led by the Haitian government and assisted by U.N. agencies and non-governmental organizations. Haitian radio reported that the worst damage was in the country's southeast. Heavy rain and strong winds persisting into the morning hours caused visible damage to trees and houses in the city of Jacmel, on Haiti's southern coast, and knocked out power. As many as 1,500 of the city's residents took refuge in a school serving as a shelter. Jacmel Mayor Hugues Paul confirmed at least one death on the outskirts of his city, voicing fears that more deaths will be reported. A 10-year-old girl also died when a wall fell on her house in Thomazeau, near Port-au-Prince, the country's civil protection agency said.

      "article is: (CNN) -- Canadian aviation company Bombardier is taking a \"major bet\" on the notoriously cut-throat passenger plane market, spending around $3.5 billion to compete with well-established rivals Boeing and Airbus, its chief executive Guy Hachey says. The money will be invested in Bombardier's new C Series aircraft, which has the capacity to seat 100 to 150 passengers. Bombardier faces obstacles, including the dominance of its competitors in the market and the eurozone financial crisis, which has hit the aviation industry hard. But the company is in a strong position to target a market that has been \"under-served\" by the major players, Hachey said. Watch: How to buy planes . \"So far, we've been serving customers up to about 100 seats, more in the regional segment. Now we're cracking into more of the mainline segment. We're investing about $3.5 billion -- for the size of our company that is a very significant investment,\" he told CNN. \"If you look at our company we have two groups -- a group of about $10 billion on the rail side and $10 billion in aerospace. But it is a major bet for the corporation.\" Cutting edge design . Hachey said Bombardier's competitive edge lies in the design of its planes. Until now, this market had largely been served by the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737. However these smaller versions of planes -- called \"shrinks\" --- were also much heavier. The other option was Brazilian company Embraer's E-195 -- known as a \"stretch\" -- but it cannot fly as far in one go. In comparison, Hachey said Bombardier's C Series will deliver an \"optimized product\" built specifically for the 100 to 150-seat market. On its website the company says its aircraft will be lighter and more fuel efficient, yet provide a \"best-in-class, wide-body cabin environment.\" Taking on the major players . Bombardier's ambitions -- even with this new approach to design -- are high, given the long history of Airbus and Boeing in these markets. Founded in 1942, Bombardier is a relatively new kid on the aviation block. The company expanded from trains to planes in the 1980s and is now the third largest aircraft manufacturer. Its aerospace division now employs 33,600 people, with an annual turnover of Â£8.6 billion. According to Hachey, the company now has the scale to take such challenges. Watch: Three CEOs in a cockpit . Hachey is hoping to capitalize on demand for around 7,000 aircraft in the 100 to 150-seat segment over the next 20 years. So far Bombardier has secured 330 commitments and 138 firm orders for its new aircraft. Hachey, who worked in the automotive industry for 30 years before moving to planes, said: \"We feel very comfortable with the level of production we have going forwards, so we are very happy with our position.\" Beyond Europe . As European markets continue to take a battering, Hachey says Bombardier will be expanding its focus elsewhere. In the past year the company has doubled its sales force in emerging countries, with a renewed push in the U.S. \"In Europe typically \n",

A peaceful sit-in on Friday against government plans to demolish a park was met with a police crackdown, igniting the biggest anti-government riots this city has seen in a decade. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan demanded an end to the violent protests, which have also spread to the capital city of Ankara and the port city of Izmir. \"The police were there yesterday, they are there today, and they will be there tomorrow. Taksim Square cannot be allowed to be a place where marginal groups can freely roam,\" he said in a televised speech. The clashes in Istanbul subsided Saturday afternoon, when police allowed protesters to flow into the square. The protesters pelted police vehicles with stones as they withdrew from the area. At least 79 people, including 26 members of the Turkish security forces, were injured in the clashes across the country, Interior Minister Muammer Guler told Turkey's semi-official Anadolu news agency on Saturday. Among the injured were 14 in Istanbul, including one who suffered brain trauma, the Istanbul governor's office said. Turkish authorities have detained 939 people in connection with the protests, Guler told Anadolu. In the Ankara, police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters, with some chanting \"Tayyip resign,\" as they marched on the neighborhood of Kizilay, demonstrators told CNN. \"Police are everywhere, and helicopters are monitoring our movements,\" one protester said. \"Whenever police see us march, they come and gas us. ...We were gassed, we disbursed and then gathered again.\" Erdogan conceded in his speech on Saturday that Turkish security forces had made excessive use of tear gas against demonstrators. \"There have been errors in the actions of the security forces, especially with regard to use of pepper gas. Right now that is being investigated, researched,\" he said. \"There is an error there, sure. When it is used excessively we are against it as well. And in fact there was such excess.\" Earlier Saturday crowds gathered across central Istanbul and chanted \"government resign\" and \"shoulder to shoulder against fascism\" as phalanxes of helmeted riot police responded with volleys of tear gas canisters. Lost amid the explosion of anti-government anger in the streets of Istanbul and elsewhere was the original source of the protests. Earlier this week, several dozen activists tried to stage a sit-in in Gezi Park, the last bit of green space left in Taksim Square. The demonstrators were protesting government plans to level the park and replace it with a reconstruction of a replica Ottoman-era military barracks and a shopping mall. The protests have since devolved into a demonstration against Erdogan, the most powerful, popular and polarizing leader Turkey has seen in generations. This major transport hub and commercial district has become the main battleground between angry protesters who hurled stones and bottles at riot police.

      "article is: (CNN) -- President Barack Obama has taken a lot of flak lately, some of which has been deserved. But there is one issue that history is likely to show that he deserves major props for innovation and courage -- climate change. Indeed, the deal concluded with China this week marks another example in which the President has bucked conventional wisdom, attacks from the climate deniers, and even lukewarm support from parts of his own party scared to be honest about the impact of fossil fuels or to come up with creative solutions to the challenges posed by climate change. Let's start with innovation. The clichÃ© that necessity is the mother of invention is clearly appropriate here. Domestically, despite foot-dragging and overt hostility from the Congress -- soon to get worse with the elevation of Sen. James Inhofe to chair the Senate Environment Committee -- Obama has doggedly used his executive and rule-making powers to put the country on the path toward a lower carbon future. Perhaps he has been inspired by how another president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, had to use smaller scale action like lend-lease to prepare for war, in the face of virulent opposition. But a global problem also requires international agreements, which is why -- rather than wait for the nearly 200 parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to come to agreement on a huge basket of climate-related issues -- the President is right in finding ways to work with other major greenhouse gas emitters. He hasn't given up on the UNFCCC process, but he is trying more than that. The reality is that climate negotiations have long been stalled, lost in a Groundhog Day cycle of yearly meetings ending in plans for more meetings. It's a top-down model for negotiations whose effectiveness was put in doubt by reports years ago, and one that ignores the unimpressive success rate of the hundreds of agreements on a variety of environmental challenges that followed the prototype Stockholm 1972 Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. Instead, policy makers should follow a different approach, one that has had a surprising amount of success over the years -- nuclear disarmament. Initially, the great powers bet on a single negotiating process, \"General and Complete Disarmament,\" involving all members of the United Nations. But when the Cuban Missile Crisis crystallized the very real danger of the nuclear arms race, key governments identified aspects of the overall problem on which they might find common ground. Gradually, over time, this focus on smaller targets led to solid, incremental progress toward the overarching goals. The progress really started with the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty, prohibiting nuclear testing in the atmosphere, in space, and under the seas. Issues since have been variously resolved opportunistically in multilateral, regional and bilateral fora with alternative bodies picking up the action when other efforts have stalled. The strategy was successful: In contrast to the dozens of nuclear powers expected by 2000, there are in fact only eight now, and there are still expected to be less \n",

      "article is: Houston (CNN) -- After seeing Texas Gov. Rick Perry's lackluster performance in debates and accompanying drop in the polls, some pundits conclude it would take a force of nature to save his campaign. Fortunately for Perry, such a force does exist, and her name is Sarah Palin. A dose of Palin power would do much to revitalize Perry's chances to win the Republican presidential nomination. Of course, such a coveted endorsement comes with costs. Rock stars such as Palin don't just walk into campaign headquarters asking to lend a helping hand. Perry must be committed to a careful wooing process and to meeting most of her demands, however diva-esque they may be. So why should Perry grovel at Palin's feet in solicitation of unmitigated support? Because in the big picture, Palin power is just what the campaign doctor ordered. Just envision the image of these two politicians hitting the trails in Iowa and New Hampshire, flanked by journalists and flashing cameras at every juncture. This dynamism and attention would infuse Perry's campaign with a Hollywood cachet that his opponents lack. Or better yet, imagine a commercial with Palin touting Perry as a great American and a true, true Christian (hint hint). Palin's endorsement would give the Texan more street cred among tea party constituents, generate large crowds and fill his campaign coffers till overflowing. But more decisively, Palin's advocacy would do for Perry what New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's endorsement of Mitt Romney does not, and that is excite a critical contingent of the Republican base: those pesky evangelicals who are just begging for an excuse to reject Romney. Perry's Texas charm coupled with Palin's rock-star status would get everyone talking about the Texan as a viable candidate again. With front-runner Herman Cain sidetracked by the recent revelation of sexual harassment allegations leveled at him while he ran the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s, the timing for a Perry-Palin alliance could not be better. But while it is easy to see how Perry could benefit from an infusion of Palin power, what does the Alaskan maverick with a penchant for self-promotion have to gain by pitching her potency toward Perry? With Palin's decision not to enter the race comes the threat of losing her voice. Supporting Perry would provide Palin with a plausible context to remain in the limelight, which translates into more photo ops, more speeches, more television interviews and more chances to flex her muscles. So both politicians have something to gain from joining forces. From Perry's vantage point, the Texan can win the nomination with her support. From Palin's perspective, her legend soars for saving a campaign on life support and, should Perry lose, she can save face by passionately proclaiming that she fought for the candidate and the values in which she believes. The country would also benefit from this strategic alliance because Palin's polarizing presence would force both Perry and Romney to reveal more precisely their conservative proclivities and commitments. Simply put, Palin power would push both candidates more to the right, producing a more informed \n",

      "article is: (CNN) -- The possible discovery of salmonella has prompted a limited recall of Skippy reduced-fat peanut butter spreads sold in 16 states, its parent company announced. Unilever issued a press release Friday detailing a voluntary recall of Skippy's \"Reduced Fat Creamy\" and \"Reduced Fat Super Chunk\" brands. The recall applies only to these branded items distributed in Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. While there have been no known illnesses, the recall was issued for fear that some of the peanut butter now in stores had salmonella. The press release said that Unilever acted after inspectors conducting \"routine sampling\" found that \"finished products may contain the bacteria.\" There was no indication of where exactly the contamination was found, its severity or what steps were being taken to address it beyond the recall. The recalled products are sold in 16.3-ounce plastic jars, have UPC codes of 048001006812 or 048001006782 and have best-if-used-by-dates of May 16-21, 2012, on the top, the company statement said. Those with such jars should throw them away and call Skippy at 1-800-453-3432 to get a replacement coupon, according to Unilever. The Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey-based company issued the recall in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration, which posted a copy of Unilever's statement on its government website. Salmonella is a bacterial infection that usually lasts four to seven days. About 40,000 cases of salmonellosis are reported each year in the United States, according to the CDC. Those who get it typically develop fever, abdominal cramps and diarrhea between 12 and 72 hours after becoming infected. Most people recover on their own, without needing significant treatment. But salmonella in very young and very old people, as well as those with weakened immune systems, can lead to severe illness and even death. The CDC recommends that anyone suspecting he or she may be ill from eating contaminated food should talk to a doctor. \n",

      "article is: A school in Harrow in north west London has angered teachers and MPs by telling staff not to use red ink when marking homework . Teachers have been told not to use red link to mark homework to avoid upsetting pupils. The edict has been condemned as ‘absolutely political correctness gone wild’ which risks leaving students in the dark about where they have gone wrong. Ministers have been forced to distance themselves from the bizarre policy, insisting no government rules exist on what colour pens teachers use. The policy would appear to be at odds with the back to basics approach of Education Secretary Michael Gove who has insisted teachers must mark pupils down for poor spelling and grammar. He has warned that in the past too little has been done to focus on core skills to ensure young people are confident in key writing skills. Tory MP Bob Blackman revealed his anger after being told a secondary school in his Harrow East constituency had banned teachers from using red ink. He told MailOnline: ‘A teacher . contacted me and said I cannot believe I have been instructed by my head . to mark children’s homework in particular colours and not to use . certain colours. ‘It is all about not wanting to discourage youngsters if their work is marked wrong. ‘It sounds to me like some petty edict which is nonsense. It is absolutely political correctness gone wild. ‘My take on all this is to say children need to understand the difference between what’s right and what’s wrong.’ Tory MP Bob Blackman slammed the unnamed school in his Harrow East constituency for telling teachers not to use red ink, prompting education minister Liz Truss to insist the government has not issued a ban . Mr Blackman took his concerns to ministers, tabling a parliamentary question whether the government issues guidelines which ‘prohibit or discourage the use of red ink for the purposes of marking or commenting on students’ schoolwork’. Elizabeth Truss, the ministers responsible for school attendance and cutting bureaucracy, insisted: ‘No, the Department does not issue guidelines which prohibit or discourage the use of red ink for marking student’s schoolwork.’ It is thought the policy is set by the headteacher, and not Labour-run Harrow council. Mr Blackman refused to name the school to protect the teacher who had spoken out. But he said he was going to take the issue up with the headteacher to ensure pupils were told when they had got things wrong. Mr Blackman added: ‘If they have got their homework wrong they need to be told it is wrong and to understand what the right answers are. The idea that they should use this or that colour is madness.’ A study by the University of Colorado warned that red is associated with 'warning, prohibition, caution, anger, embarrassment and being wrong' Earlier this year a US study suggested that teachers should stop using red pens because the colour is associated with 'warning, prohibition, caution, anger, embarrassment and being wrong'.

They are the Keepers of the Clock and have the unique job of upholding the world's most iconic timepiece - Big Ben. And last night was the dawn of their busiest hours of the year as the clocks went back and we moved from British Summer Time to Greenwich Mean Time. As millions enjoyed an extra hour in bed, Ian Westworth and his colleagues faced a five-hour mission to turn back the hands of Britain's most iconic clock . The bell was made in 1858 in East London and took two weeks to cool before being transported to the tower on a horse draw carriage . Once the arduous task of turning back the hands of Big Ben was complete the team set about changing the 2,000 clocks in Parliament which will take them until Monday . While millions of people welcomed the extra hour's lie in this morning, the five-strong team set in motion a complex, five-hour process to move the most famous hands in Britain with millisecond precision. The foursome were tasked with altering the 154-year-old, 13-and-a-half-tonne ageing timepiece, a focal point on the capital's famous skyline. If the notoriety was not enough, the keepers faced the prospect of high winds, the famous four faces being plunged into darkness, and the potential uproar were anything to happen to the priceless chime. However former soldier turned horological forerunner, Ian Westworth, was not fazed by the daunting job, which passed off smoothly. The veteran of nine years scales the 334 steps to the top of the iconic tower three times a week to carry out regular health checks, measure the pendulum's swing and keep a watchful eye on any deteriorating parts.

The whole process requires painstaking precision and immense skill to ensure the hands are not wound too far, as there is no rewind mechanism . As the 9.45pm chime rung out over the capital, Mr Westworth and his team went to work, beginning the intricate process. The clock wass not heard chiming again until 2am . 'We meet up as usual and take on the foreboding staircase, there’d be no other way for us as it’s part of the romance making your way up them,' said Ian.

Current testers, or \"Explorers,\" in Google's parlance, will get a chance to swap out their current models for the new ones, the company said in a Google+ post. The new Google Glass hardware will work with eyeglasses or shades, and include an ear bud to replace the speaker in the current model. The bone-conduction speaker, which, similar to some hearing aids, literally sends sound waves through the skull to the ear, has been called faulty by some testers. The swap begins Friday and testers will have 60 days to decide if they want new Glass. The roughly 10,000 current testers also be able to invite up to three friends into the program, which requires testers to fork over the current $1,500 price of the glasses. \"Over the next few weeks, all Explorers will have the opportunity to invite three friends to join the program,\" the post said. \"They'll be able to buy Glass online and can have it shipped to their home, office, treehouse or igloo. We're counting on you to get Glass to the people you think will make great Explorers.\" Google has not said when Glass will go on sale to the general public, though it is expected to be some time next year. Google Glass, worn like regular glasses, has a high-resolution display and lets wearers use voice commands to shoot photos or videos and access features like e-mail, text messaging, Google Maps, Google search and a handful of other apps. It's not clear what hardware changes will be made to make the new Glass work better with other eyeglasses, though some in the tech press were speculating that users will be able to insert prescription lenses into it. It's possible to wear both Glass and eyeglasses currently, though many users who have tried have called it awkward. The post didn't say how the overall design of Glass will be tweaked in the next version. Looking a little bit like something out of an '80s sci-fi movie, some have said the device looks ... well ... goofy, at least on the sometimes geekish early adopters who have been sporting them.

A cool million can still fetch a sizable mansion elsewhere, but in the souped-up world of San Francisco real estate it is now barely enough to cover the cost of an 800-square foot starter home that needs work .

After three unsuccessful offers, they ended up paying $913,000 for a two-bedroom, one-bath house with an outdated kitchen, a yard that can charitably be called overgrown, and a big basement that Taisch counts as its most attractive feature. ‘It certainly is a milestone.

On the giant display, which measures 108ft (33 metres) across when the 12 screens are combined, images are controlled by a Wii remote that interacts with a Kinect-like Bluetooth device called SmartTrack. And 3D glasses worn by the user create dizzying added dimensions. 'This is gold,' said fellow BYU civil engineering professor Dr Kevin Franke. 'This technology has the ability to revolutionise my job as an earthquake engineer.' Earlier this week Samsung unveiled a video content app that will compliment its Gear VR virtual reality headset. Milk VR will provide free, immersive, 360° content to users and will offer sports, music and even action videos. The launch follows the release of Milk Video and Milk Music. To use Samsung's Gear VR, users slip a Note 4 tablet into the headset to create a screen. The concept was developed with Oculus, the VR firm bought by Facebook. The VuePod creates images using point data from aircraft equipped with lidar (laser-based radar). The lidar scans the landscape and records millions of data points that are then viewed as an image on the VuePod. Point data can also be created from stitched-together photographs taken by low-cost drones. One set of data currently available for study in the VuePod captured a canyon area beneath a plateau in southern Idaho. With 3D glasses and the Wii controller, a user can virtually drop down into the canyon from above, and then fly from one end to the other. By combining two sets of data for the canyon, taken five years apart, the user can then spot changes in the natural landscape that are invisible to the human eye. This same system could be used to spot the before and after effects of an earthquake. The VuePod creates images using point data from aircraft equipped with lidar (laser-based radar). It could reveal the more 'invisible' effects of natural disasters like earthquakes. Pictured is a collapsed freeway in Oakland, California after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake .

      "article is: Washington (CNN) -- South Dakota Democratic candidate Rick Weiland was glad when his party's Senate campaign arm injected $1 million into his race, but that didn't keep him from pledging to oppose the party's leader in the chamber. Weiland said Thursday during a televised debate that he would vote against prolonging Sen. Harry Reid's tenure as the Democratic Leader, and challenged his Republican opponent Gov. Mike Rounds to pledge to oppose Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell as the Republican leader. \"Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell have given us the most dysfunctional government in a generation and they need to step aside,\" Weiland said. Weiland's pledge to oppose his party's leader in the Senate doesn't come as much of a surprise to those following the race. Behind the scenes, Reid not-so-quietly opposed Weiland's bid to be the party's nominee in South Dakota, which set off a feud between Reid and former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, who backed Weiland's bid. How South Dakota became the Senate fight surprise . But Weiland framed his opposition in anti-Washington terms, calling Washington \"broken\" and both parties \"beholden to big money.\" \"Our Congress has been bought off and nothing is going to change until we get the money out of our politics,\" Weiland said. \"The people of South Dakota deserve more than business as usual.\" Weiland has gained a reputation for his folksy campaign style, even writing and performing modified renditions of popular songs -- turning \"Wagon Wheel\" into a song about his low-budget campaign. And despite the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's $1 million investment in South Dakota, the support didn't flow directly to Weiland -- instead funding attack ads against Rounds. And those attacks could bolster either Weiland's campaign or former Sen. Larry Pressler's independent campaign. Pressler, who edged out Weiland in recent polls, has not said who he would caucus with, but his previous endorsements' for President Barack Obama's two presidential campaigns have fueled speculation that he could caucus with Democrats if elected. Could Independents tip the balance of the Senate? Dana Bash contributed to this report. \n",

In an affidavit filed to the Queensland Supreme Court by Gable Tostee's lawyers during his bail application, Emily Ellis, who lived below Gable Tostee's 14th floor apartment, provides a graphic re-enactment of 26-year-old Ms Wright's fatal plunge.

      "article is: WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Internet-based rip-offs jumped 33 percent last year over the previous year, according to a report from a complaint center set up to monitor such crimes. The report said that about 77.4 percent of perpetrators of Internet fraud were men. The total dollar loss from those crimes was $265 million. That's $26 million more than the price tag in 2007, the National Internet Crime Center said. For individual victims, the average amount lost was $931. \"This report illustrates that sophisticated computer fraud schemes continue to flourish as financial data migrates to the Internet,\" said Shawn Henry, the FBI's assistant director of the Cyber Division. Americans filed 275,284 reports claiming to be ripped off on the Internet, the highest number reported since the center began keeping statistics in 2000. The dollar loss has been on a steady increase since 2004, while the number of cases referred to law enforcement has decreased steadily since that same year. Complaints to the center have resulted in several arrests, the center said, although information comes only from agencies that voluntarily provide the results of investigations. Henry said the figures show the need for computer users, in businesses and in homes, to be wary and use sound security practices while using the Internet. The center said the top three most frequent complaints were about merchandise that wasn't delivered or payment that wasn't received, Internet auction fraud and credit/debit card fraud. Other scams include confidence frauds such as Ponzi schemes, check fraud, the Nigerian letter fraud and identity fraud. One popular identity fraud scam used during 2008 involved sending e-mails crafted to appear as if they'd been sent by the FBI. Sometimes the scammers went so far as to say the mailings were from FBI Director Robert Mueller himself, according to the center. The e-mails would ask the recipient for personal information, such as a bank account numbers, claiming the FBI wanted the information to look into an impending financial transaction. One variation of the scheme, according to the center, was to send an e-mail saying the recipient is entitled to lottery money or an inheritance and the funds can be moved as soon as bank account information is supplied. The FBI has issued warnings about such scams in the past, and Monday's report included a new one: \"The FBI does not contact U.S. citizens regarding personal financial matters through unsolicited e-mails.\" The report said that about 77.4 percent of perpetrators of Internet fraud were men, and about half lived in either California, New York, Florida, Washington, Texas or the District of Columbia. More than 55 percent of those who filed complaints were men. But the report noted that anyone who uses the Internet can be a victim, and that the ages of victims have ranged from 10 to 100. Internet crime offers unique challenges to investigators. The report said the offender and victim often live in different states and sometimes different countries, requiring multiple law enforcement agencies to cooperate and conquer any issues of jurisdiction. Another big problem is the anonymity of using the Internet. In \n",

It took firefighters around 20 minutes to cut the pair free before they were taken to Hackensack University Medical Center, NJ.com reported. They had to remove the roof and one of the doors in order to get the pair out. Firefighter Michael Thomasey told CBS 2: 'Everybody that saw the distance that the car fell was just taken back by the fact that they had not been injured more severely and that they were able to talk to us. Sgt. Jeff Flynn, a State Police spokesman, said the single-car crash was reported at 7:12 a.m. on the highway's eastbound lanes. The cause of the wreck remained under investigation, Flynn said. Workers nearby said they saw a snow embankment with two tire tracks nearby, and feel the flare of the sun may have been to blame. Hackensack Fire Lt. Justin Derevyanik, who was one of the first on the scene, told CBS: 'God was watching over them today. It landed on a tree which probably padded the fall a little bit and then on a fence.' Other officers said if the car had landed on its roof it would have been a different story.

      "article is: Republican leaders on Capitol Hill are changing their approach in the battle to block President Barack Obama's unilateral changes to the immigration system. After Senate Democrats on Monday filibustered for the fourth time a bill that would defund the president's immigration measures while fully supporting the rest of the Homeland Security Department, Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said he would introduce new legislation targeting Obama's immigration 'overreach' that is not tied to appropriations for DHS. House Speaker John Boehner, through an aide, swiftly backed his Senate counterpart's move, creating an avenue for the GOP to end its standoff with the president - who on Tuesday again pressured congressional Republicans to take up immigration reform - and his party before a Friday evening deadline to fund DHS or allow it to temporarily shutdown. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday night he was changing his approach in the battle to block President Barack Obama's unilateral changes to the immigration system . Staredown: McConnell is now pursuing legislation that target's Obama's immigration 'overreach' but is not tied to appropriations for DHS as a deadline to prevent a temporary, partial, shutdown of the department inches closer. In an op-ed Tuesday Obama again defended his directives and called on Congress to make permanent reforms to the nation's broken immigration system and argued that a Homeland Security shutdown would be bad for the country . Speaking on the Senate floor on Tuesday, McConnell encouraged Senate Democrats to vote for his bill to prevent the president's executive actions from being enforced. 'The bill isn’t tied to DHS funding. There’s no excuse for our friends on the other side to oppose it,' he said. McConnell asserted that the bill would take away Democrats' ability to hide 'behind all manner of excuses to avoid upsetting the Far Left' in the immigration debate and force them to say on record whether they support the president's 'extreme overreach.' The Senate's head lawmaker said it is still his preference that the upper chamber approve the House-passed legislation that funds all of the Homeland Security Department's activities except those mandated by Obama in November. 'But as long as Democrats continue to prevent us from even debating that bill, I’m ready to try another way,' he said. Following McConnell's announcement from the Senate floor on Monday night, a top aide to House Speaker Boehner indicated to reporters that his boss would back the altered strategy. 'This vote will highlight the irresponsible hypocrisy of any Senate Democrat who claims to oppose President Obama’s executive overreach on immigration, but refuses to vote to stop it,' Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said in a statement. 'If we are going to work together on the American peoples priorities, Washington Democrats must be honest with the people they represent.' The move has some conservatives concerned that McConnell may be capitulating to Democrats. Conservatives wanted to tie funding for the entire federal government to legislation undercutting Obama's immigration directives, but settled in December to a bill that would only put the Homeland Security Department's monies in jeopardy \n",

      "article is: It is a problem that affects some five million Britons. But tinnitus – or at least the risk of developing it – could be tackled by drinking three or more coffees a day. The findings, from a study involving nearly 70,000 women, suggest caffeine may have a protective effect against the condition – a constant ringing in the ears that can drive some victims to suicide. Decaffeinated coffee did not have the same benefit. Pain: Tinnitus is a crippling condition - but could be treated by drinking coffee, a controversial study suggests . Researchers in Canada who tracked coffee-drinking habits in middle-aged women found those who drank three to four cups a day were 15 per cent less likely to develop tinnitus and those on more than four cups were 20 per cent less at risk. The results, published in the American Journal of Medicine, are controversial because it was thought that too much caffeine made the ringing worse. But after a 2010 study found tinnitus . sufferers who cut caffeine out of their diets saw no improvement, with . some actually getting worse, scientists decided to look at whether the . world’s most widely-consumed stimulant might be beneficial. Rock chick: There are fears loud music gigs could put young people's hearing at risk . Tinnitus is caused by nerve damage in the inner ear. It can be caused by exposure to loud music, an ear infection or even a cold. The damage results in an abnormal stream of impulses that the brain interprets as constant sound. Many of us suffer temporary tinnitus that lasts no more than a few hours, often from a cold or from going to a loud concert. But for around one in 100 people, it becomes a long-term affliction. Experts . fear growing numbers of younger people are being affected, due to a . gradual rise in noise levels generally and the use of earphones at high . volumes. There is no cure but treatments include counselling and relaxation techniques. This is where patients listen to . background noise, such as gentle music, waves crashing on a shore or . even the hum of traffic, to distract their attention away from the . tinnitus.

McIndoe, from south-east London, stabbed himself to death after he . suffered months of constant ringing in his ears from attending a concert . by the band Them Crooked Vultures.
